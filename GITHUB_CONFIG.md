# GitHub Configuration Summary

This document summarizes the GitHub repository security configurations that have been automatically applied and those that require manual setup.

## ‚úÖ Automatically Configured

### 1. Release Approval Environment
**Status**: Configured
**Location**: Settings > Environments > release-approval

- **Required Reviewers**: trumpyla (current user)
- **Wait Timer**: 0 minutes
- **Admins Can Bypass**: Yes (default)

**What This Does**: All releases now require manual approval before they can be published, preventing automatic distribution of potentially compromised JDK builds.

### 2. Branch Protection Rules (main branch)
**Status**: Configured
**Location**: Settings > Branches > main

**Rules Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews (1 approval required)
- ‚úÖ Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging:
  - `validate-syntax`
  - `test-install-macos (macos-13)`
  - `test-install-macos (macos-14)`
  - `test-install-linux (ubuntu-22.04, x64)`
  - `test-install-linux (ubuntu-24.04, x64)`
  - `Validation Status`
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging (strict mode)
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ‚úÖ Block force pushes
- ‚úÖ Block branch deletion

**What This Does**: Ensures all changes go through proper review and testing before being merged to main.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Configuration Required

### 1. First-Time Contributor Workflow Approval
**Status**: Requires Manual Setup
**Location**: Settings > Actions > General > Fork pull request workflows

**Steps to Configure**:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/Artagon/homebrew-jdk26valhalla/settings/actions
2. Scroll to "Fork pull request workflows from outside collaborators"
3. Select: **"Require approval for first-time contributors"**

**Why This Matters**: Prevents malicious actors from running harmful workflows through their first pull request.

**Alternative Option**: For maximum security, you can select "Require approval for all outside collaborators" - but this may slow down contributions.

### 2. Enable Dependabot Security Updates
**Status**: Currently Disabled (seen in repository settings)
**Location**: Settings > Security > Code security and analysis

**Steps to Enable**:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/Artagon/homebrew-jdk26valhalla/settings/security_analysis
2. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Dependency graph (if not already enabled)
   - ‚úÖ Dependabot alerts
   - ‚úÖ Dependabot security updates

**What This Does**: Automatically creates pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies.

### 3. Enable Secret Scanning
**Status**: Currently Disabled
**Location**: Settings > Security > Code security and analysis

**Steps to Enable**:
1. Navigate to: https://github.com/Artagon/homebrew-jdk26valhalla/settings/security_analysis
2. Enable:
   - ‚úÖ Secret scanning
   - ‚úÖ Push protection for secrets

**What This Does**: Prevents accidental commits of API keys, tokens, and other secrets.

## üîç Configuration Verification

### Verify Release Approval Environment
```bash
gh api repos/Artagon/homebrew-jdk26valhalla/environments/release-approval
```

Expected output should include:
- `"protection_rules"` with `"type": "required_reviewers"`
- Your username in the reviewers list

### Verify Branch Protection
```bash
gh api repos/Artagon/homebrew-jdk26valhalla/branches/main/protection
```

Expected output should show:
- `"required_pull_request_reviews"` enabled
- `"required_status_checks"` with all validation jobs listed
- `"required_conversation_resolution": true`

### Test Release Approval
The next time you push changes to `Casks/jdk26valhalla.rb` or `Formula/jdk26valhalla.rb`:
1. The release workflow will trigger
2. You'll see a pending deployment waiting for approval
3. Navigate to: https://github.com/Artagon/homebrew-jdk26valhalla/actions
4. Click on the running workflow
5. Click "Review deployments" to approve/reject
